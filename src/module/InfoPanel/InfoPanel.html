	<blockquote class="quote speech-bubble"><p>In traditional MVC, the model and view are made aware of each other, which might permit disadvantageous comingling of view (e.g., user interface) concerns into the model (e.g., database) and vice versa, when the architecture might have been better served by the schema of the database and the presentation of information in the user-interface are divorced entirely from each other and allowed to diverge from each other radically. </p>
